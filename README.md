2. Motivation for Choosing Technologies
Why These Technologies Were Chosen:
PHP: PHP was chosen for the server-side development because it is ideal for dynamic web applications. It allows for easy interaction with databases and managing user sessions.
MySQL: MySQL was used to store all data (users, videos, comments, messages) because it is a reliable and scalable database management system, enabling efficient data handling.
HTML/CSS: HTML and CSS were used to structure the pages and style them. These technologies ensure that the website is visually appealing and accessible across various devices.
JavaScript: JavaScript was used to enhance user interaction by enabling dynamic content updates without reloading the page. This made the interface more responsive and user-friendly.



3. Development Decisions
What Was Decided During Development:
Database Structure: The database structure was designed with several tables for users, videos, comments, and messages. These tables are linked through foreign keys to maintain data integrity.
Security: Security was a top priority. Password hashing and session protection were implemented to ensure that only authorized users could access specific features, such as the admin panel.
Scalability: The system architecture was designed to be scalable, allowing for easy future feature extensions. It can handle an increase in the number of users and videos without significant performance degradation.
User Experience: Special attention was paid to the user experience. The design is responsive and adapts to different devices, allowing users to interact with the platform seamlessly, whether on mobile or desktop.
